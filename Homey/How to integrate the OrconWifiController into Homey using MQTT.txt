How to integrate the OrconWifiController into Homey using MQTT

1. Make sure that you are running the correct firmware on the OrconWifiController.
2. Make sure you have an MQTT broker set up and running.
3. Configure the Wifi network and MQTT credentials on the OrconWifiController
4. Add the OrconWifiController to Homey.

1. Make sure that you are running the correct firmware on the OrconWifiController.
The reason for separate firmware is because the OrconWifiController will reboot every 15 minutes or so when it is not connected to an MQTT broker.
- Power on the OrconWifiController using a USB cable
- After a few minutes, a Wifi network named "OrconWifiController" should appear in your available networks.
- Connect to this network using the password: "12341234"
- Open a web browser and navigate to http://192.168.4.1 and fill in your Wifi network credentials
- Once the OrconWifiController connects to your Wifi network, it will obtain an IP address from your router.
- Go to the OrconWifiController web page by using http://orconwificontrollermqtt/ or use the IP address of the OrconWifiController.
- If you can see text fields to enter MQTT server details, you are running the correct firmware. If not, you need to flash the correct firmware using http://web.esphome.io/ or use the OTA upload button in the webserver.
- The firmware file you can find here: https://github.com/hubertjanhickinson/OrconWifiController/blob/main/Homey/orconwificontrollermqtt.bin

2. Make sure you have an MQTT broker set up and running.
- If you do not already have an MQTT broker, you can install one using the Homey app store.
- Install this app: https://homey.app/en-nl/app/nl.scanno.mqttbroker/MQTT-Broker/
- Configure the app, remember the IP address, port, username and password you set for the MQTT broker.

3. Setup the Wifi network and MQTT server on the OrconWifiController
- Go to the OrconWifiController web page by using http://orconwificontrollermqtt/ or use the IP address of the OrconWifiController.
- On the webpage, enter the details of the MQTT broker you set up in step 1 (IP address, port, username, password)
- Click the "Save MQTT Config and Reboot" button to save changes and reboot.

4. Add the OrconWifiController to Homey.
- Use the topics in 'OrconWifiControllerTopics.txt' to add MQTT devices in Homey.
